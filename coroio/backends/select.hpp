 * @class TSelect
 * @brief Poller implementation based on the select() system call.
 *
 * TSelect inherits from TPollerBase and implements asynchronous I/O polling using
 * the select() system call. It manages file descriptors using fd_set structures (or
 * equivalent containers on nonâ€‘Windows systems) and provides helper functions for
 * obtaining pointers to the read and write fd_sets.
 *
 * On Windows, a dummy socket is maintained to handle timeouts correctly.
 *
 * The class also defines convenient type aliases:
 *  - @c TSocket is defined as NNet::TSocket.
 *  - @c TFileHandle is defined as NNet::TFileHandle.
 *
 * Main method:
 *  - @ref Poll() is called to perform the select() operation and process events.
 *
 * @see TPollerBase, NNet::TSocket, NNet::TFileHandle.
