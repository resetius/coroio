/**
 * @class TKqueue
 * @brief Poller implementation using kqueue (for macOS and FreeBSD).
 *
 * TKqueue inherits from TPollerBase and provides asynchronous I/O event polling based on
 * the kqueue API available on BSD-based systems (including macOS and FreeBSD). It manages
 * events through an internal list of kevent structures.
 *
 * The following type aliases are defined for convenience:
 *  - @c TSocket is defined as NNet::TSocket.
 *  - @c TFileHandle is defined as NNet::TFileHandle.
 *
 * Main methods:
 *  - The constructor and destructor (@ref TKqueue() and @ref ~TKqueue()) handle initialization
 *    and cleanup of the kqueue descriptor.
 *  - @ref Poll() waits for I/O events using kqueue, processes the changes, and updates internal
 *    event lists.
 *
 * Internal data members include:
 *  - @c Fd_: The kqueue file descriptor.
 *  - @c InEvents_: A container of all registered events.
 *  - @c ChangeList_: A vector storing modifications (kevent changes) to be applied.
 *  - @c OutEvents_: A vector to collect events returned by kevent().
